0x01. Python - Async

Introduction

This project delves into asynchronous programming in Python, focusing on leveraging the asyncio module. The tasks entail creating asynchronous coroutines, executing multiple coroutines concurrently, measuring runtime, and managing asyncio tasks.

Tasks

    The Basics of Async
        Implement an asynchronous coroutine wait_random to introduce random delays.

    Execute Multiple Coroutines Concurrently
        Write an async routine wait_n to execute wait_random multiple times concurrently.

    Measure Runtime
        Develop a function measure_time to evaluate the runtime of wait_n and calculate the average time per execution.

    Managing Async Tasks
        Create functions task_wait_random and task_wait_n to manage asyncio tasks effectively.
