0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

description:
This project focuses on implementing variable annotations in Python 3. It covers various tasks that demonstrate understanding of type annotations, function signatures, variable types, duck typing, and code validation with MyPy.

Tasks:

0. Basic annotations - add: 
   Write a type-annotated function add that takes two float arguments and returns their sum as a float.

1. Basic annotations - concat: 
   Write a type-annotated function concat that takes two string arguments and returns their concatenation.

2. Basic annotations - floor: 
   Write a type-annotated function floor that takes a float argument and returns its floor value.

3. Basic annotations - to string: 
   Write a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float argument and returns its string representation.

4. Define variables: 
   Define and annotate integer, float, boolean, and string variables with specified values.

5. Complex types - list of floats: 
   Write a type-annotated function sum_list that takes a list of floats as argument and returns their sum.

6. Complex types - mixed list: 
   Write a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum.

7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple: 
   Write a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string and an int or float and returns a tuple.

8. Complex types - functions: 
   Write a type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier and returns a function that multiplies a float by multiplier.

9. Let's duck type an iterable object: 
   Annotate a function element_length to take a list and return a list of tuples containing each element and its length.

10. Duck typing - first element of a sequence: 
    Annotate a function safe_first_element to take a sequence and return its first element or None.

11. More involved type annotations: 
    Add type annotations to a function safely_get_value to take a dictionary, key, and default value and return the value or default.

12. Type Checking: 
    Use MyPy to validate code for a function zoom_array and make necessary changes.
